# Secure-Online-Payment-System-Using-RSA-Encryption

**📌 Project Overview** :

This project is a secure online payment system designed to protect sensitive financial transactions using the RSA encryption algorithm. The system ensures secure communication between users and payment gateways by encrypting sensitive data like credit card details before transmission, preventing unauthorized access.

**💡 Features**:

🔹 Secure Payment Processing – Uses RSA encryption to protect user financial data.
🔹 User Authentication – Secure login and authentication mechanism.
🔹 Encryption & Decryption – RSA-based encryption for card details and transaction data.
🔹 Transaction Safety – Secure data transmission between client and server.
🔹 Frontend & Backend Implementation – Built with HTML, C++, and RSA algorithm for encryption.

**⚙️ Tech Stack**:

Frontend: HTML, CSS
Backend: C++ (handling RSA encryption & decryption)
Encryption Algorithm: RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)

**🔑 How It Works?**:

The user enters payment details.
The system encrypts sensitive data using the RSA public key.
The encrypted data is sent to the server for processing.
The server decrypts the data using the RSA private key.
The payment is processed securely.
